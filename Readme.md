# Next Movie

This is a learning project. I'm using it to learn a few new frameworks and libraries:

- Next.js
- React-Query
- Tailwind CSS v3

This is a pretty much unscoped app using the [TMBD API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)

## Roadmap

I work better when I write down what I have to do, so here is a very sophisticated roadmap.

### Setup

- [ ] Setup Next.js with Typescript
- [ ] Setup eslint
- [ ] Setup prettier
- [ ] Make first request using react-query
- [ ] CI using Github Actions
- [ ] Deploy
